                <h2>"The Lord has been my strength and guide through every trial..."</h2>
                <p>Born and raised in a Christian family in India, my personal relationship with Jesus deepened through trials and experiences. From overcoming fear and stress with the promises of Scripture to trusting Him through a severe accident, I've seen God's faithfulness at every turn.</p>
